Meiosis and Mitosis
===================

Haploid Cell
------------
- contains 1 set of all chromosomes (2 chromatids)

Diploid Cell
------------
- contains 2 sets of all chromosomes (2 chromatids each)

Mitosis
-------
- occurs in all organisms
- produces 2 haploids
- does not create genetic variation

Meiosis
-------
- occurs in the sex cells of certain organisms
- produces 4 haploids
- helps with genetic variation
