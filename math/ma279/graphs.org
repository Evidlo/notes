*graph* - consists of vertices and edges

[[./eulergraph.png]]

*euler paths* - uses each edge once

If G has an euler path, then
 - all vertices must have even degree except for start and end
 - start and end are either both odd or even
:proof:
If two points are odd and rest are even, delete 1 path which connects
the two vertices.  Then all paths are even and you can find an euler circuit.
Now use the deleted path to connect the odd vertices. 
:END:

*euler circuit* - uses each edge once and returns to start

If G has an euler circuit, then
 - it must be connected
 - deg of every vertex is even

If G has an even degree, then
 - it can be seen as a union of circuits
:HierHolzer:
Start following circuit I until you reach circuit II
Continue on circuit II until you reach III
...
Continue on circuit m until you reach n
Finish m
Finish n
...
Finish II
Finish I
:END:
 
*euler circuit* â‡” G has even degree
