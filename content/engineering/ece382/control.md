Control Theory
==============

![](control_panel.png)

__*plant*__ - a physical object to be controlled (ex. heating element)
__*disturbance*__ - signal that adversely affects the output of a system

Feedback Systems
----------------
__*closed loop*__ - error between output and desired value of plant is fed back to controller
__*open loop*__ - output has no effect on controller action
