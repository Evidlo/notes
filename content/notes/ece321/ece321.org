* Flux and Flux Density

  $$\phi = \int_S B \cdot \overrightarrow{dS}$$

  #+begin_examples
  Let a uniform flux density flow through some surface $S_m$ at various angles.  Find the flux.
  a) $$\int_{S_m} B \cdot \overrightarrow{dS} = (B \hat{a_y}\ \text{T})(S_m \hat{a_y}\ \text{m}^2) = BS_m\ \text{Wb}$$
  b) $$\int_{S_m} B \cdot \overrightarrow{dS} = (B \hat{a_y}\ \text{T})(S_m \frac{\hat{a_y} + \hat{a_z}}{\sqrt{2}}\ \text{m}^2) = \frac{BA}{\sqrt{2}}\ \text{Wb}$$
  c) $$\int_{S_m} B \cdot \overrightarrow{dS} = (B \hat{a_y}\ \text{T})(S_m \hat{a_z}\ \text{m}^2) = 0\ \text{Wb}$$

* Gauss's Law and Kirchoff's Flux Law

  Since there are no magnetic monopoles, we have $$\oint B \cdot \overrightarrow{dS} = 0$$ (Gauss's Law)

  Written another way, using the relation from before: $\sum \phi = 0$ (Kirchoff's Flux Law)

* Relation to Ohm's Law

  $F = \phi \underbrace{R}_\text{reluctance}$

* DC Machines
  Some DC machines have two separate electrical systems.

** Field Winding
** Armature Winding
   The voltage across the armature winding can be given by 

   #+begin_proof
   $$v_a = i_a r_a + \text{coil EMF} = i_a r_a + \frac{d}{dt} \lambda_{aa}$$

   where $\lambda_{aa} = L_{aa} i_a + L_{af} i_f$
  
   so $v_a = r_a i_a + L_{aa}$
   #+end_proof

** Separately Excited Machine
   [[./dc_separated.png]]
   #+begin_definition
   $$v_a = r_a i_a + L_{AF} i_f \omega_r + \underbrace{L_{AA} \frac{d}{dt} i_a}_0$$

   $$T_e = L_{AF} i_a i_f$$

   $$P_{out} = T_e \omega_r$$

   $$P_{in} = v_a i_a + v_f i_f
   #+end_definition
** Shunt Connected Machine
   [[./dc_shunt.png]]
   In a shunt connected machine, $v_t = v_a = v_f$, and $i_t = i_a + i_f$.
   #+begin_definition
   $$T_e = L_{AF} \frac{V_t}{r_f}(1 - L_{AF}\ \omega_r / r_f)$$

   Stall torque: $L_{AF} \frac{V_t^2}{r_f r_a}$
   No load speed: $\frac{r_f}{L_{AF}}}$

   $$P_{out} = T_e \omega_r$$

   $$P_{in} = v_a i_a + v_f i_f
   #+end_definition
** Series Connected Machine
   [[./dc_series.png]]
   In a series connected machine, $v_t = v_a + v_f$ and $i_t = i_a = i_f$.

   #+begin_definition
   $$v_t = r_a i_t + L_{AF} \omega_r i_t + r_f i_t$$

   $$T_e = L_{AF} i_t^2$$
   #+end_definition

** Permanent Magnet Machine
   #+begin_definition
   $v_a = r_a i_a + \underbrace{L_{AF} i_f}_{k_v} \omega_r + \underbrace{L_{AA} \frac{d}{dt} i_a}_0$

   $T_e = \underbrace{L_{AF} i_f}_{k_v} i_a$
   #+end_definition
* Field Energy and Coenergy
* Force
  force: $f_e = - \frac{dW_f(\lambda, x)}{dx}$

  force: $f_e = \frac{dW_c(\i, x)}{dx}$

* AC Machines
  In an AC machine, the poles on the stator rotate (via switching) and the poles on the rotor follow them. Teeth in AC machines are designed to allow flux flow in one direction and current flow orthogonally.

  For a given frequency, each additional pole reduces the machine speed by $p/2$, i.e. $\omega_{rm} = \frac{2}{p} w_e$

** Mechanical Position
   $\theta_{rm}$ - measures rotor position relative to stator - counterclockwise
   $\phi_{rm}$ - an arbitrary position relative to rotor - counterclockwise
   $\phi_{sm}$ - an arbitrary position relative to stator - counterclockwise
** Electrical Position
   $\phi_s = \phi_{sm} \frac{p}{2}$
   $\phi_r = \phi_{rm} \frac{p}{2}$
   $\theta_r = \theta_{rm} \frac{p}{2}$
** Distributed Winding
   There are two ways to represent windings.
** Discrete Winding
   $$N_{x,i}$$ is the number of conductors of an `x` phase winding in the `i`th slot.

   [slot and tooth locations]
   where $y$ is either $r$ for stator or $r$ for rotor

   slot locations:$\phi_{ys,i} = 2 \pi(i - 1)/S_y +phi_{ys,1}$
   tooth locations: $\phi_{yt,i} = 2 \pi(i - 1/2)/ S_y +phi_{ys,1}$

   Conductors coming out of the page are positive, and going in are negative.

   Summing the number of conductors in every slot should yield zero:
   $$\sum_{i=1}^{S_y} N_{x,i} = 0$$
** Continuous Winding
   $n_x(\phi_{ym}$ is the conductor density
   - $x$ is the winding phase - 'a', 'b', 'c', ...
   - $y$ is the location - 's' for stator

   *conductor density example*
   
   *total conductors*

** Symmetry
   Due to the construction of the machine, the following statements are always true.
   #+begin_definition
   *Machine Symmetry*
   $N_{x,i + 2 S_y / p} = N_{x,i}$ - regions that are two steps apart behave identically
   
   $N_{x,i + S_y/p = -N_{x,i}$ - regions that are one step apart behave oppositely

   The same concept applies to discrete windings.
   $n_x(\phi_m + 4 \pi / p) = n_x(\phi_m)$

   $n_x(\phi_m + 2 \pi / p) = -n_x(\phi_m)$
   #+end_definition

   Where moving one pole means $\frac{2 \pi}{p}$ radians, $\frac{S_y}{p}$ slots

** Winding Arrangement Notation
   [[./winding_arrangement.png]]

   $$N_{as} \right_{1-18} = N [ 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 -1 -2 -2 -1 0 0]$$

   $p = 4$
   $S_s = 36$

** Winding Types
   The following windings have the same number of conductors in the slots, but they differ in terms of loss, amount of copper, and difficulty to wind.

   [[./winding_types.png]]

** Winding Function
   For DC machines, MMF drop was defined as $F = iN$, where $i$ is the current and $N$ is the number of windings.

   For AC machines, we define the MMF drop in a similar way.

   #+begin_definition
   $F = iW$

   where $W$ is the winding function

   $$W = $$
   #+end_definition

* Useful Relations

  *reluctance* : $R = \frac{l}{A \mu}\ \text{H}^{-1}$, where $l$ is length, $A$ is area, and $\mu$ is permittivity
    note that $\mu$ is not always constant and can depend on conductor current

  *flux* : $$\phi = \frac{Ni}{R} = \int_A \overrightarrow{B} \cdot d \overrightarrow{S}$$, where $N$ is the number of loops, $i$ is the current, $R$ is reluctance, $B$ is the flux density, and $A$ is the cross sectional area

  *flux linkage* : $\lambda = N \phi = Li$, where $N$ is the number of loops

  *MMF drop* : $$F = Ni = \phi R = \oint \overrightarrow{H} \cdot d \overrightarrow{l}$$

  $V = \frac{d \lambda}{dt}$

  *co energy* : $$W_c = \left[ \int_{0}^{i_{1,f}} \lambda_1 di_1 \right]_{\substack{i_2 = 0 \\ ...}} + \dots + \left[ \int_{0}^{i_{n,f}} \lambda_n di_n \right]_{\substack{\dots \\ i_{n-1} = i_{n-1,f}}} = \frac{1}{2} i^T L i$$

  *conservative system* : $$\left[ \begin{matrix} \lambda_1 \\ \vdots \\ \lambda_n \end{matrix} \right] = \underbrace{\left[ \begin{matrix} L_{11} & \dots & L_{1n} \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ L_{n1} & \dots & L_{nn} \end{matrix} \right]}_{\text{inductance matrix}} \left[ \begin{matrix} i_1 \\ \vdots \\ i_n \end{matrix} \right]$$

  if the inductance matrix is diagonally symmetric, then the system is conservative because $$\frac{d \lambda_j}{d i_k} = \frac{d \lambda_k}{d i_j}$$

  *force* : $$f_e = \frac{1}{2} \frac{dL}{dx} i^2$$
  *torque* : $$T_e = \frac{1}{2} \frac{d \lambda}{d \theta_r} i^2$$

  nick north : $$\frac{(\overrightarrow{H} \times \overrightarrow{C}) \times \hat{z}}{\left|(\overrightarrow{H} \times \overrightarrow{C}) \times \hat{z}\right|}$$
