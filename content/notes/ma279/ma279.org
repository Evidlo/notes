* Voting
#+begin_definition

*ballot* - ordering of candidates

*method* - way of counting ballots

*criterion* - requirements on the result of a method
#+end_definition
** Criteria
*majority criteron* - a candidate with more than half of the votes should win

*condorcet criterion* - a candidate that wins head-to-head with all others should win

*plurality criterion* - a candidate with the most votes overall should win

*monotonicity criterion* - a change in votes which only favors a candidate should help that candidate
** Methods
*** Plurality Method
- the candidate with the most 1st place votes wins
- fails condorcet criterion

#+begin_examples
1. Plurality with elimination fails monotonicity

   | 7 | 8 | 10 | 4 |
   |---+---+----+---|
   | A | B | C  | A |
   | B | C | A  | C |
   | C | A | B  | B |

   C wins

   If 4 players vote for C instead of A...

   | 7 | 8 | 14 |
   |---+---+----|
   | A | B | C  |
   | B | C | A  |
   | C | A | B  |
 
   B wins, even though the votes for C increased
#+end_examples
*** Plurality Method with instant drop off
- a candidate with more than half of 1st place votes wins, otherwise eliminate the last place candidate and repeat
- fails condorcet,

*** Borda count method
- assign weights to each position on the ballot and sum total points for each candidate
- fails condorcet criterion
*** Pairwise compare method (Copeland's method)
- count number of permutations of candidate pairs where X beats Y, give X one point
- the candidate with the most points wins
- passes plurality and condorcet

** Ranking and Extended Voting Methods
*** Recursive
 - use voting method, remove winner and repeat process
*** Extended Methods
- *borda* - rank by Borda number
- *pairwise* - rank by number of comparisons won
- *plurality* - rank by total first place votes
** Weighted Voting
Each players vote has a weight $w_n$ for either supporting or rejecting a motion

[q : $w_1$, $w_2$,...]

#+begin_definition
- *quota* - minimum number of votes needed to carry a motion
- *gridlock* - q is more than all votes
- *anarchy* - the number of votes for and the number against a motion are more than the quota
- *dictator* - a player that has more votes than the quota
- *unsuspecting dummy* - a player that has no impact on the result
  - eg [30: 10, 10, 10, 9]
#+end_definition
    
*** Banzhaf Power Index
Characterizes voting power of a player

\[\beta_i = \frac{B_i}{B_1 + ... + B_N}\]

where $B_i$ is the number of coalitions where player i is a critical player (removing them would cause the coalition to lose)

#+begin_examples
1. [5: 3, 2, 1, 1]

   Winning coalitions: (with critical players bolded)

   | *A* B C D |
   | *A B* C   |
   | *A B*     |
   | *A C D*   |
   | *A B* D   |

  $B_A = 5$ 

  $B_B = 3$ 

  $B_C = 1$ 

  $B_D = 1$ 
   
  \[\beta_A = \frac{5}{5 + 3 + 1 + 1} = \frac{1}{2}\]
#+end_examples

* Division
#+begin_definition
*goods/booty* - things to be divided amongst players

*player preferences* - how each player values goods

*fair share* - at least $\frac{1}{n}$ of the goods available to a player

*divisible goods* - money, pizza, land, etc.

*indivisible goods* - house, car, horse, etc.
#+end_definition

** Continuous Division
*** Divider-Chooser
- Two players.  Player 1 divides the goods and player 2 chooses which share to take.
- Chooser always has an advantage.  They can choose the share that caters to their own value system
*** Lone Divider
- One player divides the booty into equal shares.  A third party must allot the shares so that all players get what they consider a fair share


#+begin_theorem
*Wedding Theory*
- N boys want to marry N girls
- boys can only marry girls they know

There can't be a good match if K players collectively like less than K unique items
#+end_theorem

#+begin_examples
1. Divider has broken booty into shares I, II and III.  Fair shares for each player have been marked.

   |       | I             | II            | III           |
   | $D$   | $\frac{1}{3}$ | $\frac{1}{3}$ | $\frac{1}{3}$ |
   | $C_1$ |               | fair          | fair          |
   | $C_2$ | fair          | fair          |               |

   - give I to $C_2$
   - give II to $D$
   - give III to $C_1$

2. Divider has broken booty into shares I, II and III, IV.  Fair shares for each player have been marked.

   |       | I             | II            | III           | IV            |
   |-------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------|
   | $D$   | $\frac{1}{4}$ | $\frac{1}{4}$ | $\frac{1}{4}$ | $\frac{1}{4}$ |
   | $C_1$ |               |               |               | fair          |
   | $C_2$ |               | fair          | fair          |               |
   | $C_3$ |               |               |               | fair          |

   - give I to $D$
   - give II or III to $C_2$
   - give II, III, or IV to $C_1$, $C_2$
#+end_examples

*** Lone Chooser
1. divide booty into 2 fair shares using above methods
2. $D_1$ and $D_2$ each divide their share into 3 fair shares
3. $C$ chooses $\frac{1}{3}$ of a share from $D_1$ and $D_2$

*** Last Diminisher
1. Player 1 takes a fair share of the booty and passes it to Player 2.
2. Player 2 either cuts down the share to what he thinks is fair, or doesn't change it and passes it down
3. Share continues to Player N.  The share goes to the last player who considered it fair

This is fair to the last player because all pieces he rejected were less than a fair share, so the remaining piece
must be a fair share.

** Discrete Division
*** Markers
1. Put all goods in a line and have each player place N-1 markers to divide the goods into fair shares.
   [[./graphic]]
2. Give the first share to Player A
   [[./graphic]]
3. Remove the all the markers for the first share and Player A's markers. Repeat for Players B,...,N

Player A always gets exactly a fair share

Other players get at least a fair share
*** Sealed Bids
- N players bid for N-1 items
- Top bid for each item wins the item
- The item winners pay back the difference of the value of the item they won and what they consider a fair share
   $(\text{won item value} - \frac{\text{total item values}{N})$
- The amount payed back can be a negative value
- the value of a loser's item is 0
- The leftover money is always positive
* Apportionment
How do we assign the seats in Congress to populations of states?

The sum of all shares of seats must equal the total seats available.

#+begin_definition
- $A_1,...,A_N$ - states to assign seats to
- $P_i$ - population of each state
- $M$ - seats in congress
- $SD = \frac{P}{M}$ - standard divisor (people corresponding to each state)
- $q_i = \frac{P_i}{SD}$ - standard quota (fair share of seats for a state)

*Quota Criterion*

Each state should get either $\lfloor q_i \rfloor$ or $\lceil q_i \rceil$ seats
#+end_definition

** Hamilton's Method
1. Find the fair share for each state ($q_i$) and give them the floor
2. Assign the remaining seats to the states with the largest leftover fraction ($q_i - \lfloor q_i \rfloor$)

#+begin_examples
1. 
   |                       |     A |      B |    C |     D |    E |     F | $\sum$ |
   |-----------------------+-------+--------+------+-------+------+-------+--------|
   | $P_i$                 |  1646 |   6936 |  154 |  2091 |  685 |   988 |  12500 |
   | $q_i$                 | 32.92 | 138.72 | 3.08 | 41.82 | 13.7 | 19.76 |    250 |
   | $\lfloor q_i \rfloor$ |    32 |    138 |    3 |    41 |   13 |    19 | 246    |

   Give 4 remaining seats to $A, D, F, B$
#+end_examples

#+begin_theorem
With a decrease in $M$ (the number of seats available), 
it is possible for the number of seats assigned to a state to increase.
#+end_theorem
** Jefferson's Method
- population and $M$ are fixed
- modify $SD = \frac{P}{M}$ so that \[\sum \lfloor q_i \rfloor = \sum \lfloor ( \frac{P_i}{P} M ) \rfloor = M\]
- new $SD$ \leq old $SD$

#+begin_examples
1. 
   |                       |     A |      B |    C |     D |     E |     F | $\sum$ |
   |-----------------------+-------+--------+------+-------+-------+-------+--------|
   | new $q_i$             | 33.25 | 140.12 | 3.11 | 42.24 | 13.84 | 19.96 |        |
   | $\lfloor q_i \rfloor$ |    33 |    140 |    3 |    42 |    13 |    19 |    250 |

   2 extra seats for $B$ violates quota criterion
#+end_examples


** Adam's Method
- identical to Jefferson's method, but using ceiling
- modify $SD = \frac{P}{M}$ so that \[\sum \lceil q_i \rceil = \sum \lceil ( \frac{P_i}{P} M ) \rceil = M\]
- new $SD$ \geq old $SD$

#+begin_examples
1. 
   |                       |  A |   B | C |  D |  E |  F | $\sum$ |
   |-----------------------+----+-----+---+----+----+----+--------|
   | $\lceil q_i \rceil$ | 33 | 137 | 4 | 42 | 14 | 20 |    250 |
#+end_examples

** Webster's Method
- identical to Adam's and Jefferson's, but using rounding
- modify $SD = \frac{P}{M}$ so that \[\sum \text{round} (q_i) = \sum \text{round} ( \frac{P_i}{P} M ) = M\]

#+begin_examples
1. 
   |                     |     A |      B |    C |     D |     E |     F | $\sum$ |
   |---------------------+-------+--------+------+-------+-------+-------+--------|
   | new $q_i$           | 32.85 | 138.44 | 3.07 | 41.74 | 13.67 | 19.72 |        |
   | $\lceil q_i \rceil$ |    33 |    138 |    3 |    42 |    14 |    20 |    250 |
#+end_examples

** Huntington-Hill
- similar to webster, but rounding using geometric mean

- if $\frac{P_i}{P} * M \geq \sqrt{N(N+1)}$ use ceiling
- if $\frac{P_i}{P} * M \leq \sqrt{N(N+1)}$ use floor
* Apportionment
** Apportionment Definition
#+begin_definition
*apportionment* - how to scale congress to population of states?
\[A_1 ... A_N\] - states

$N$ - number of states

$P_i$ - population of a state

$M$ - seats available in congress

$SD = \frac{P}{M}$ - standard divisor, people per seat

$q_i = \frac{P_i}{SD}$ - fair share of seats for state
#+end_definition

*quota rule* - every state should either get floor($q_i$) or ceil($q_i$)

** Apportionment methods
*** Hamilton's Method
Give everyone the floor of their fair share.  Assign the remaining n seats to n states with highest remainder.
#+begin_examples
1. | State |     A |      B |    C |     D |    E |     F |   sum |
   |-------+-------+--------+------+-------+------+-------+-------|
   | $P_i$ |  1646 |   6936 |  154 |  2091 |  685 |   988 | 12500 |
   | $q_i$ | 32.92 | 138.71 | 3.08 | 41.82 | 13.7 | 19.76 |   250 |
   | floor |    32 |    138 |    3 |    41 |   13 |    19 |   246 |

   So remaining for seats are assigned to A,B,D,F
#+end_examples
*** Adam's Method
Modify $SD$ until the sum of the ceils of fair shares of seats is equal to the total seats available

$\sum \lceil(q_i)\rceil = \sum \frac{P_i}{SD} \geq M$

so $SD$ needs to be increased until

$\sum \lceil(q_i)\rceil = \sum \frac{P_i}{SD} = M$

*its possible to violate the quote rule*

*** Webster's Method
Same as Adam's method, but using rounding.

$\sum \lceil(q_i)\rceil = \sum \frac{P_i}{SD} \approx M$

so increase or decrease $SD$ until 

$\sum \lceil(q_i)\rceil = \sum \frac{P_i}{SD} = M$
*** Hunting-Hill Method
This method is currently in use today.

Find the geometric mean of the ceiling and floor of the the fair shares for each state.
If the fair share is greater than the geometric mean, use the ceiling.
If the fair share is less than the geometric mean, use the floor.

If $q_i \geq \sqrt{\lfloor q_i \rfloor \lceil q_i \rceil}$, use $\lceil q_i \rceil$
If $q_i \leq \sqrt{\lfloor q_i\rfloor \lceil q_i \rceil}$, use $\lfloor q_i \rfloor$

* Graphs
** Euler Paths
[[./eulergraph.png]]

*euler paths* - uses each edge once

If G has an euler path, then
 - all vertices must have even degree except for start and end
 - start and end are either both odd or even

#+begin_proof
If two points are odd and rest are even, delete 1 path which connects
the two vertices.  Then all paths are even and you can find an euler circuit.
Now use the deleted path to connect the odd vertices. 
#+end_proof

*euler circuit* - uses each edge once and returns to start

If G has an euler circuit, then
 - it must be connected
 - deg of every vertex is even

If G has an even degree, then
 - it can be seen as a union of circuits

*Hierholzer Algorithm*

Spanning trees in $K_N$: $n^{n-2}$
* Exponential Growth

There is a pair of rabbits.  A pair of rabbits takes 1 year to mature, and another to produce offspring.  What is the population at year n?

| $n$   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| $m_n$ | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 |
| $m_n$ | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 |
| $p_n$ | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 13 |

where $n$ is the year, $y_n$ is the number of young rabbits, $m_n$ is the number of mature rabbits, and $p_n$ is the total population

$p_n = \frac{1 - \lambda_1}{\lambda_2(\lambda_2 - \lambda_1)} \lambda_1^n + \frac{1 - \lambda_2}{\lambda_1(\lambda_1 - \lambda_2)} \lambda_2^n$

where $\lambda_1,\lambda_2 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2},\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$
#+begin_derivation
So $y_{n+1} = m_n$, $m_{n+1} = m_n + y_n$, $p_n = y_n + m_n$

$m_{n+1} = m_n + m_{n-1}$

$p_t = p_{t-1} + p_{t-2}$

$p_t = C * \lambda^t = C$

$C*\lambda^t = C * \lambda^{t-1} + C* \lambda^{t-2}$

$\lambda^2 = \lambda + 1 \Rightarrow \lambda = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$

$p_n = C_1 \lambda_1^n + C_2 \lambda_2^n$


$1 = p_1 = C_1 \lambda_1 + C_2 \lambda_2$

$1 = p_2 = C_1 \lambda_1^2 + C_2 \lambda_2^2$

solving the linear system yields

\[C_2 = \frac{1 - \lambda_1}{\lambda_2(\lambda_2 - \lambda_1)}\]

\[C_1 = \frac{1 - C_2}{\lambda_2(\lambda_2 - \lambda_1)} = \frac{1 - \lambda_2}{\lambda_1(\lambda_1 - \lambda_2)}\]

So let $s_u = \frac{1 - \lambda_1}{\lambda_2(\lambda_2 - \lambda_1)} \lambda_1^n + \frac{1 - \lambda_2}{\lambda_1(\lambda_1 - \lambda_2)} \lambda_2^n$

where $s_1,s_2 = 1,2$ are the initial conditions.
#+end_derivation

#+begin_theorem
If $(a)$ is a sequence with a recurrence of depth 2,

then $a_n = C_{n-1}a_{n-1} + C_{n-2}a_{n-2}$

with initial conditions $a_1,a_n = A_1,A_2$

Let $\lambda_1,\lambda_2$ be the roots of $\lambda^2 = C_{n-1} \lambda + C_{n-2}$

then $a_n = b_1 \lambda_1^n + b_2 \lambda_2^n$
#+end_theorem

#+begin_examples
1. Let $a_n = 3a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2}$, $a_0 = 1$, $a_1 = 1$

   Find $\lambda$

   $\lambda^2 = 3 \lambda - 2$

   $\lambda1,\lambda2 = 1,2$

   Find $b_1,b_2$ using initial conditions

   $1 = a_0 = b_1 1^0 + b_2 2^0 = b_1 + b_2$

   $1 = a_1 = b_1 1^1 + b_2 2^1 = b_1 + 2 b_2$

   So $b_1 = 1, b_2 = 0$

2. Let $a_n = 6a_{n-1} - 11a_{n-2} + 6a_n - 3$, $a_0 = 1, a_1 = 2, a_2 = 7$

   $\lambda^n = 6\lambda^{n-1} - 11\lambda^{n-2} + 6\lambda^{n-3}$

   Divide out $\lambda^{n-3}$

   $\lambda^3 = 6\lambda^2 - 11\lambda + 6$

   Making guesses for roots: $\lambda = \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6$

   our roots are $\lambda = 1,2,3$

   so the guess for the solution is $a_n = A1^n + B2^n + C3^n$

   Substituting our initial conditions:

   $1 = a_0 = A1^0 + B2^0 + C3^0 = A + B + C$
   $1 = a_1 = A1^1 + B2^1 + C3^1 = A + 2B + 3C$
   $7 = a_2 = A1^2 + B2^2 + C3^2 = A + 4B + 9C$

   Solving the system yields $A = \frac{3}{2}, B = -2, C = \frac{3}{2}$

** Golden Ratio
#+begin_definition
The golden ratio $\phi$ is defined as an irrational number where

$\phi^2 = \phi + 1$

$\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$
#+end_definition

The golden ratio can be found in many places in nature, from population modelling to the number of chambers in a nautilus shell.

An interesting property of the golden ratio is that the ratio of two consecutive fibonacci numbers approaches $\phi$ as $N$ gets large.

$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{F_N}{F_{N-1}} = \phi$

   Divisors of 6 as possible roots: -6, -3, -2, -1, *1*, *2*, *3*, 6

Sequence of equal payments at regular time intervals

*Deferred*

Making regular payments and collecting at some point in the future (investment)

#+end_definition

* Motions
#+begin_definition
*Motion*

Let $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$

Let $A \in M_{m \times n}, B \in \mathbb{R}^m$

Then the mapping $(A,B): \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $(A,B) \overrightarrow{v} = A\overrightarrow{v} + b$

is called a motion
#+end_definition

- motions have an inverse and an identity, which makes all motions a *group*
- motions are associative and have an inverse

We can find the size of a motion in various dimensions

In dimension 1, $A^TA = 1$, so $A = 1$ and $A$ has 0 degrees of freedom + 2 degrees of freedom for $B$

In dimension 2, $A^TA = 1$, so $A$ has 1 degree of freedom + 2 degrees of freedom for $B$

** Rotation
If a motion is a rotation about the origin, it has the form 
$$A = \left( \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\alpha) & -\sin(\alpha) \\
\sin(\alpha) & \cos(alpha)
\end{bmatrix} \right)$$

** Finding a motion for some input and output
If $\overrightarrow{v}$ and $(A,B)\overrightarrow{v}$ are given, there is a line of possible points for the center of rotation

** Proper motions
A motion is proper if $\det(A) = 1$.

ie. A motion rotates the input, but does not flip

If $\det(A) = -1$, then the motion is called improper and flips the system as well as rotates

*If a pair of points are reflected and shifted by the same amount, how can we find the axis of reflection and the shift?*

* Symmetry groups
#+begin_definition
*Symmetry group*

Let $G$ be the set of motions such that the system $X$ looks the same before and after

$G$ is called a symmetry group
#+end_definition

- symmetry groups are not commutative (ex. rotating an object, then flipping is not the same as flipping then rotating)

#+begin_definition
*Dihedral group*

The set of motions which preserve the look of a regular polygon is called a dihedral group
#+end_definition

** Frieze patterns (Border Patterns)

We can classify various line patterns based on their symmetries

Type name convention: *xy*

*x* can be m or 1
  - m - reflection, vertical axis
  - 1- no reflection
*y* can be m, g, 2, or 1
  - m - reflection, horizontal axis
  - g - glide reflection
  - 2 - $180^{\circ}$ rotation
  - 1 - no reflection

#+begin_definition
*Glide reflection*

Flip a pattern over the horizontal axis, then translate it left or right:

** Mandelbrot Set
The Mandelbrot set is named after Benoit Mandelbrot, a mathematician at Yale University who developed his fractal theories while working for IBM.

#+begin_definition
*Mandelbrot Sequence*

$a_{n} = a_{n - 1}^2 + s$

$a_0 = s

where $s$ is called the seed
#+end_definition

Mandelbrot sequences can either be escaping, attracting, or periodic, depending on their behavior at infinity.

#+begin_examples
1. *Periodic*

   Let $s = -1$

   | $a_1$ |  -1 |
   | $a_2$ |   0 |
   | $a_3$ |  -1 |
   | ...   | ... |

2. *Escaping*

   Let $s = 1$

   | $a_1$ |  1 |
   | $a_2$ |   2 |
   | $a_3$ |  5 |
   | ...   | ... |

3. *Attracting*

   Let $s = \frac{-3}{4}$

   | $a_1$ | $\frac{-3}{4}$ |
   | $a_2$ |  $\frac{-3}{16}$ |
   | ... |  ... |
   | $a_n$ | $\frac{-1}{2}$ |

#+end_examples

To generate an image from the Mandelbrot set, we evaluate the behavior of all seeds in the complex plane and assign a color
based on the speed that the seed escapes or attracts.

** Game of life
*** Rules
- if a live square has less than 2 or more than 3 neighbors, it dies
- if a dead square has 3 neighbors, it comes to life

** Fractal Dimension
Various shapes we are familiar with can be assigned a dimension.  For example, a line, a square, and a cube have dimensions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Since these shapes are self similiar (they can be constructed from smaller versions of themselves) we can define a formula for calculating dimension.

#+begin_definition
Let $N$ be the number of self similar children, $S$ be the scaling ratio of a child to parent, and $D$ be the dimension of the shape we are studying.

Then $N = S^D$
#+end_definition

#+begin_examples
1. Assume a straight line made of 4 equal line segments.

   We know $N = 4$, $S = 4$,

   so $D = 1$
2. Assume a square made of 16 equal squares

   We know $N = 16$, $S = 4$,

   so $D = 2$
3. Assume a cube made of 64 equal cubes.

   We know $N = 64$, $S = 4$

   so $D = 3$
4. Assume a Sierpinsky gasket

   *incomplete*

   Since a sierpinsky gasket is made of 3 half-size versions of itself

   we know $N = 3$, $S = 2$

   $3 = 2^D$

   \[D = \dfrac{\log (3)}{\log (2)}\]


5. Assume a sponge (3D carpet)

   *incomplete*

   Since X is the union of 20 third-size copies of itself,

   we know $N = 20$, $S = 3$

   $20 = 3^D$

   $D = \frac{\log{20}}{\log{3}}$
#+end_examples

** Collatz conjecture
#+begin_definition
Start with $X \in \mathbb{N}$
   - if X is divisible by 2, divide it by 2
   - otherwise, multiply by 3 and add 1

You will always reach 1.
#+end_definition

This conjecture remains unproven.
* Sampling
#+begin_definition
*statistic* - the result drawn from a sample

*parameter* - the actual value that the statistic attempts to estimate

*target population* - set to evaluate

*sample population* - sampled subset

*sampling frame* - where lists of the sample population are obtained (eg, magazine subscription lists, club membership).  Adds selection bias to the polls
#+end_definition
** Capture-Recapture Method
Used to determine total populations.  Assumes population exhibits Brownian (random) motion.

1. Capture n indivudals from the population
2. Tag each individual and release them again
3. Allow the tagged individuals to mix with the population
4. Capture m individuals from the population.
5. If there are t tagged individuals in the m captured individuals, the population is approximately \[N = \frac{n}{\frac{t}{m}}\]
** Random Sampling
In theory, random sampling is simply randomly sampling N individuals that all have an equal chance of being sampled.

This is difficult to implement in practice, as *sampling bias* leads to skewed results.  Alternative sampling methods are an attempt to correct this sampling bias.

** Quota Sampling
#+begin_definition
*Quota Sampling*

1. Using prior knowledge about the sampling population, create profiles based on characteristics of individuals (eg. white males, asian females, etc.)
2. Determine the percentage of individuals that make up each profile
3. When conducting the study, ensure that a proportionate number of individuals matching each profile is sampled
#+end_definition

Quota sampling requires that you know enough about the population beforehand to generate a comprehensive list of profiles.  This is often not the case.

Despite the potential for reducing sample bias between profiles, quota sampling is still flawed in that it assumes individuals within each profile have a similar opinion.
#+begin_examples
1. In 1916-1932, the Literary Digest journal conducted voting polls that were "scientifically reliable".
   
   25% of all voters were sampled

   In the 1936 election - Landon (R-Kansas), Roosevelt (D):
   
   prediction: 57% Landon
   results: 38% Roosevelt

   At the same time, George Gallup asked 50,000 people and predicted the result within 1%.  He also predicted what the Literary Digest would predict 
   with a sample size of 3,000 people.

   Gallup focused on eliminating bias by sampling in person and prescribing quotas for certain profiles.

   eg. 7 white males over 40, 5 black males under 40, etc.
#+end_examples

** Stratified Random Sampling
Stratified random sampling is similar to quota sampling, but an attempt is made to randomly select individuals within each profile.

* Statistics and Probability
#+begin_definition
*Independence*

Events $E_1$ and $E_2$ are independent iff

$P(E_1 \cap E_2) = P(E_1) * P(E_2)$
#+end_definition
#+begin_definition
*Conditional Probability*

$P(E_1 | E_2) = \frac{P(E_1 \cap E_2)}{P(E_2)}$

if $E_1$ and $E_2$ are independent, then $P(E_1 | E_2) = P(E_1)$
#+end_definition
#+begin_examples
1. Let the sample space be $S = {2,...,12}$ (rolling 2 fair dice)

   Let $E$ - even sum, $F$ - sum $\geq$ 9

   | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |  9 | 10 | 11 |

   $P(E) = .5$

   $P(F) = \frac{10}{36}$

   $P(E|F) = \frac{P(E \cap F)}{P(F)} = \frac{4}{10}$
