#+TITLE: CLEP Biology Review
* Meiosis and Mitosis
*centromere* - attachment point for chromosome
*chromosome* - has one centromere, might consist of 1 chromatid or 2 sister chromatids
*chromatid* - hunk of DNA, might be a chromosome, or a sister chromatid
*chromatin* - unravelled DNA
** Haploid Cell
- contains 1 set of all chromosomes (2 chromatids)
- sex cells

** Diploid Cell
- contains 2 sets of all chromosomes (2 chromatids each)
- all other cells

** Mitosis
- occurs in all organisms
- produces 2 haploids
- does not create genetic variation

** Meiosis
- occurs in the sex cells of certain organisms
- produces 4 gametes (1 set of chromatids)
- helps with genetic variation

Interphase
- cell is diploid (:w


Meiosis I
- prophase - chromosomes pair up
- metaphase - chromosomes recombine
- anaphase - chromosomes pulled apart (ana- - back)
- telophase - cells split (telo- - end)

* Cells
*isotonic* - same water concentration in and outside
*anabolism* - builds molecules by consuming energy
*catabolism* - process of breaking down molecules for energy
*krebs cycle/citric acid cycle* - cycle where organisms breakdown carbs/fats/etc for energy
** Cellular Structures
*ribosomes* - produce protein
*mitochondria* - create ATP during cellular respiration
*lysosome* - handle waste in a cell
*endocytic vesicles* - the cell wall "eats" a particle
*centriole* - where microtubules attach during reproduction

** Cellular Respiration

** Enzymes
- help catalyze reactions


* Binomial Nomenclature
_genus species_

 - kingdom > phylum > class > order > family > genus > species
 - king phillip came over from great spain

*arthropoda* - insects, bees
*aves* - birds
*annelid* - segmented worms
*nematoda* - round worms
*porifera* - sponge
*cnidaria* - jellyfish
*sporophyte* - fern
*prothallus* - also a fern
*bryphytes* - mosses, no xylem, phloem
* Ecosystems
*differential reproduction* - the fittest organisms will survive long enough to reproduce
*hardy-weinberg* - genotypes stay the same in the absence of environmental factors
*allopatric speciation* - separation of organisms results in separate evolutionary paths
** r/K Selection
- _r selected_ - describes organisms with high growth rates, high mortality, fast sexual maturity
- _K selected_ - describes organisms with low growth rates, low mortality, long parental care

- _cofactor_ - complementary molecule that works with an enzyme to catalyze stuff

- _catalyst_ - lowers activation energy for reaction
- _endergomic reaction_ - absorbs energy from environment
- _CAM photosynthesis_ - used by some plants in arid environments to reduce water loss
* Insects
*spiracles* - respiratory organs
* Plants
** Tissue
_phloem_ - carries nutrients
_xylem_ - carries water
*meristem* - allows roots to grow quickly
** Behavior
_calvin cycle_ - light independent reactions inside a plant
*photolysis* - process of breaking down molecules by light
*angiosperm* - flowering
*gymnosperm* - seeding
*phototropism* - orient towards light
*saphrophytic* - feeding on dead matter

* Prefixes
*epi* - 
*iso* -
*ecto* -
*meso* - 
* History
*pre-cambrian* - some soft-bodied organisms, plants 
*cambrian* - large emergence of multicellular organisms
*mesozoic* - dinosaurs, ended with mass extinction
*cenozoic* - current era, flowering plants
*paleozoic*
* Human Body
*cerebrum* - speech
*cerebellum* - motor skills
*forebrain* - smell
*pituitary gland* - controls other glands and hormones (master gland)
*pancreas* - makes insulin

*collagen* - connective tissue (vitamin C helps with its creation)
*vitamins* - organic cofactors

** Reproduction
*** Embryo
*germ layers* - the various layers in an embryo
*endoderm layer* - gut lining and internals
*mesoderm* - muscles, skeleton, reproductory
*ectoderm* - skin
** Diseases
- hemophilia
- color blindness
