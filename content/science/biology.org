* Meiosis and Mitosis
- _centromere_ - 

** Haploid Cell
- contains 1 set of all chromosomes (2 chromatids)
- sex cells

** Diploid Cell
- contains 2 sets of all chromosomes (2 chromatids each)
- all other cells

** Mitosis
- occurs in all organisms
- produces 2 haploids
- does not create genetic variation

** Meiosis
- occurs in the sex cells of certain organisms
- produces 4 haploids
- helps with genetic variation

* Cells
** Cellular Structures
- _ribosomes_ - produce protein
- _mitochondria_ - create ATP during cellular respiration

** Cellular Respiration

** Enzymes
- help catalyze reactions


** Binomial Nomenclature
_genus species_

 - kingdom > phylum > class > order > family > genus > species

* Ecosystems

** r/K Selection
- _r selected_ - describes organisms with high growth rates, high mortality, fast sexual maturity
- _K selected_ - describes organisms with low growth rates, low mortality, long parental care

- _cofactor_ - inorganic substances which catalyze or assist with catalization

- _catalyst_ - lowers activation energy for reaction
- _endergomic reaction_ - absorbs energy from environment
- _CAM photosynthesis_ - used by some plants in arid environments to reduce water loss

* Plants
** Tissue
_phloem_ - carries nutrients
_xylem_ - carries water
** Behavior
_calvin cycle_ - light independent reactions inside a plant
