Meiosis and Mitosis
===================
- __*centromere*__ - 

Haploid Cell
------------
- contains 1 set of all chromosomes (2 chromatids)
- sex cells

Diploid Cell
------------
- contains 2 sets of all chromosomes (2 chromatids each)
- all other cells

Mitosis
-------
- occurs in all organisms
- produces 2 haploids
- does not create genetic variation

Meiosis
-------
- occurs in the sex cells of certain organisms
- produces 4 haploids
- helps with genetic variation

Cellular Structures
===================
- __*ribosomes*__ - produce protein
- __*mitochondria*__ - create ATP during cellular respiration

Cellular Respiration
--------------------

Enzymes
-------
- help catalyze reactions


Binomial Nomenclature
=====================
__*genus species*__

 - kingdom > phylum > class > order > family > genus > species

Ecosystems
==========

r/K Selection
-------------
- __*r selected*__ - describes organisms with high growth rates, high mortality, fast sexual maturity
- __*K selected*__ - describes organisms with low growth rates, low mortality, long parental care


- __*cofactor*__ - inorganic substances which catalyze or assist with catalization

- __*catalyst*__ - lowers activation energy for reaction
- __*endergomic reaction*__ - absorbs energy from environment
- __*CAM photosynthesis*__ - used by some plants in arid environments to reduce water loss
